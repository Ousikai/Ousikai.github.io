A man trudges along through life with an unremarkable past and no clear future. Everyday is the dreaded cycle of despair as he gets up, goes to work, returns home, and repeats the tasks endlessly. His only saving grace is virtual reality, where even just for a brief moment, he can pretend to be somewhere else. 

Someone else. 

Someone who matters and does things that matter. 

Fleeting as it may, the salvation lasts just as long as the battery lasts, and once the screen turns black, he comes back again to reality and faces himself. Even this too was slowly losing its glimmer, until one day he receives a peculiar invitation for a new VR experience he does not remember signing up forâ€¦
