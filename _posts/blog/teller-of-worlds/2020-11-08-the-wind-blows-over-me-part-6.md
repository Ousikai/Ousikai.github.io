*Preface: this is my series of RAW and UNEDITED daily posts for NaNoWriMo. It’s going to be extremely imperfect, lauden with grammatical and spelling errors, but brimming with potential. I post it mostly for myself, but invite any daring souls to try and keep up with the winds that blow me to tomorrow :wind_face:.*

# Day 87 (NaNoWriMo Part 6)     
## Chosen of the Moon

The moment of greatness was upon me.

The long season of hiberantion for crypto was over, and signs of blooming flowers and bull testerone filled the autumn air. The price of BEETCOIN soared to almost 16 thousand munnies starting yesterday (coincindentally my birthday no less), and the rest of the cryptocurrency world was following in tandem. $10, $11, $12, the price of my beatufil LANKS was soaring before my very eyes. Freedom was almost at hand. I just had to to buy a little more with my paycheck just depostited into my accoutn today, sell some of asscciate stock purchase stock I passively waiated to grow, send them to my hardware wallet....

My train of thought had been derailed from the expected strict limits of my self-imposted schedule. I was already massive behind my Virtual Reality World Builds homework, so I was planning to crush today's meetings as soon as possible and focus on that. I was already feeling a bit lightheaded from staying up late this past week to finish my other self-imposted writing homework, and last night was especially brutal as I wanted to savor the moment of appreciating being alive while trying to casually slip away from birthday festivities to finish the tasks at hand. I work hard now in the hopes that I can still work hard tomorrow, but on my own terms. After enacting ally my theorectical crypto transations to digital proofs, I closed all my apps, and noticed the time of greatness was upon me once again. The wildkittes meeting, a connucupia of progressive and future-thinkking leaders of tomorrow, utilzing the ever-evolving digital scope of existence to roadmap all the possibilties for humanity's next step. It was a refreshing outlook of thinking, to start to build towards tomorrow instead of being trapped in today and yesterday, and I made it a goal to attend every meeting I comfonrtably could. Moments like this appear and flicker out just as bruiefly.

----

Around an hour an and half passes, and I gleefully depart from the wildkittez BOOM meeting. My body wants to rest, my mind pleads for a mental moment of respite, but I have to chug onwards. I'm already late for another engagment, and a work one at that, so I close my personal latop, adroned with a plethaora of adorable and goofy anime stickers I've collected over the years, tuck it away into my personal blug backpack, and pull out the gleaming PEARbook pro, a shiny example of how my company spares no expense for employee productiveity. I flip open my work latop, insput one of 7 rottating passwords in the name of security (this sucks), hop onto the corporate proxy to block out nefarious iinternet entities from peeking on my confidential property code which counts how many words an HR document containts, and BOOM into another meeting. My two teammates sit in the meeting room with their mics off and video turned off. I couldn't see or hear them, but I mentally internalized they were sitting and pouting with their arms crossed as I yet again showed up late to another work meeting. 

"It's okay guys, I'm finally here."

Yesterday was the day of my company's first ever hackathon. Time and time again I forgot that a corporate-sponsosted hackathon is not a showcase to demonstrate what new and brimming technolgies witll turn the world flat on its own head: nononono, it's just a quick injection of cash to stimulate new engineering solutions that the company could take and profit from further, and rewards the creators of such amazing ideas a meager stipend to to give the illusion of success. Knowing all this, I couldn't contain myself either. It was an excuse to work on something exciting instead of the drab word-counting code I drudged on daily. And I had the perfect candidate for my own nerfaroious pplots: virtual reality worlds.

As so we schemed, and found a candidate that was basicalyl a complated projected, a online world-building editor with pre-created world! Excellent, my two teammate and will each take a world, add some minor modifications, link the rooms together, and....

Dolphins, its already 4PM. So much for quick and easy scheme to get out of working. And wow, world building takes quite a bit of time. I can see now why games regulalry take months of not years to develop and release. Despite  our cheesy plan to get out of work early blowing up in our face, my teammates and I had a fun time just chatting and working on something different for a change. It was nice. I hope we get the chance to do this again.

The moment of greatness was upon us. In a randomly (I was skeptical at the "random") sorted decision, our team was slotted to present first! Good, my nerves gring on me the later I present, and I just wanted to get this out of the way and log off for the day. 

"*Alright team NaHRuto, you are up.*"


**COUGH**

I turn on my BOOM webcam and microphone, and dramatically cough into my clenched fist to draw every's attention. Pandemic or not. 

"*What if I could show you a world, where these tiresome BOOM meetings became a remnant of yesterday?*"

---

A rousing amount of virtual applause later, our team walked off the BOOM centerstage (just a sqare on everyone's meeting square) and virtually high-five each other over [funny-name-alternative-for-slack-maybe-slick?-maybed-distract-yeah-i-like-distract] disctract. 

"*That was amazing, Keir! We're a shoo-in to win!*"

Dozens of messages trickle in through the DISTRACT messengar which I had muted during the presneation, now bleeping and blooping with all manner of congratulations from various viewers in the BOOM meeting room. My ego welling up, I let my pride corript what I consider to be my humble soul. Riding the adrenaline of certain vicyory, I stuck around to view and support the rest ofthe porjects presented i nthe hackathaon. They was no chance they would win, not after that key-up presenation I just wowed everyone with. Sitting in my high chair, I leaned back to take in much much more my body and mind despierately clinged onto for consion intake.

We lost. What the :dolphin:, we LOST. And it wasn't even to a GOOD project. Second place just had an idea, no demo or anything. And first place... also had a demo with slightly nicer presenation slides. Unbelievable. The idea wasn't even good. A "safe space bot" I internally mocked and dubbed it. First place's idea was a DISTRACT bot added to public DISTRACT channels, sending messages to any users who use a word that can be misconstrued as "derragortaory and insenstive". The example the team gave was a user saying "whitespace" to designate the space between words on a page. "*Why not use **empty space**? The bot polititely messaged in a private messager to the user*." 

The judges roared at the novetly of this idea. With an increasingly destablizing and chaotic life leaking into even the world place, with a pandemic, social injustice, and now a milestone election in tow, tensions rise high. The usual DISTRACT moderators can no longer keep up with te amount of incidents happing in the messger cyber space. This bot would be their salvation, and since it was a bot the user in question could not keep raging tot a human for their correction. Any ill-founded emotions would fall on deaf ears.

The idea of the bot disgusted me to my core. Subtle and automationic censorship was something I internally stood against, but I didn't have a clear reason why. My gut disgusted was more and more words were being "lost" to political correctiness. I understand the terminaloogy "master-slave" desribing computer relations between outdated and insesntive as our nation was founded on such human-versionso f the relatitonship. I underatand "male-female" describing the ends of the crods and the ports they are inserted into being pervasiveness: it was an innieduo was phsyical human relations. But "white space" and "hey guys"? Really? This was insane. And the bot correctly you had no room to explain WHY this word was insenstive. To understand what the crux of the issue was instead of banadging a society wound that grew deepera nd more infected each day. "*Just use empty space, buddy. It'll be better for everyone if you did.*"

Disgusting. I made a passing comment to my teammates that we were cheated and the compeition was rigged, and dryly wanted to take back my words as a national election of milestone importance was undergoing ballot-counting at the same time. It had been the third day since the elcection was officially supposed to call the results, but I had tuned out after the first delay. Someone would be elected, but I had more pressing matters ahead of me in the moment. And just at the asme time too, the LOUGLE form for selecting people's choice out of the remaining hackathon particpants was released. And someone just found out you vote multiplate times from the same computer for the same team. Great. Even more democratic tensions in an already echasting environemnt. I closed my corporate laptop and went home. As soon as I went home, I crashed into bed intending to take a quick power nap and work on my VR homework before my next engagment. That plan was a bust, as my body and mind took over I was irresingnly driving beyond my limimits for over a week now.

The bright blue sky streaked with white narrow clouds were gone, and the afterglow of the orange sunset made its way for the purple overtones of the night.
